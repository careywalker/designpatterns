# Design Patterns in C#

## Behaviourial Patterns

### Observer Pattern

#### Intent

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and update automatically.


### Strategy Pattern

#### Intent

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

### Template Pattern

#### Intent

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Creational Patterns

### Abstract Factory

#### Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structural Patterns

### Composite Pattern

#### Intent

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Decorator Pattern

#### Intent

Attach individual responsibilites to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sublassing for extending functionaliaty.
